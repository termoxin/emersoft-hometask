# Emersoft hometask

This Next.js application shows an example of React blog application.

Since the basic implementation of this task as has been said should take 2-3 hours on average there left some stuff for improvements, namely points below are applicable for real-world production blog):

- Make app fully compliant with WAI-ARIA (even though some of parts of the app can be detected and interacted with by screen readers, but it'd be great to have a full WAI-ARIA coverage when it comes to real-world blog)
- Add tests coverage
- Provide better type safety
- Get rid of redundant re-renders (e.g. leverage `useReducer` hook to set a few pieces of state in one action)
- Create documentation for components and functions (e.g. Storybook)
- Provide caching (SWR internal functionality)
- Add better error handing and some error tracking software (e.g. Sentry)
- Modern blogging platforms are not simple blog apps, they are complicated systems that has been built with care about readers and content creeators
- And so many other features ⭐
